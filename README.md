# How it works
This game takes FNF: Psych Engine charts, instrumental channels, opponent & player vocal channels, background photo or video. There are a few prebuilt songs from the base FNF game, but some of them don't work correctly or don't load. The EXTRA charts are more stable and feature some WIP features.
